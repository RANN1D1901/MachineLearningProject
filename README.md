# MachineLearningProject
This is the project for course SIT 307(Data Mining and Machine Learning).
The data is cleaned, processed and prepared for the algorithms using Python libraries, dataset used is Melbourne Housing Dataset, easily available at Kaggle.
The second part of the project involves applying Machine Learning techniques for price prediction of the houses using regression and classification is implemented to classify houses in certain categories using classification algorithms.
This project was done in a Group of other University students.
